<summary>ðŸ“… Week 2 â€“ Baby SoC Fundamentals (Research Summary)</summary>

### ðŸ”¹ Introduction

This week was focused on understanding the **Baby SoC (System-on-Chip)** â€” what it actually is, how it works, and what the main building blocks inside it are.  
Itâ€™s more like the *foundation week* where I got to know how everything in an SoC â€” CPU, memory, I/O, PLL, DAC â€” all work together to form a small complete computer on a chip.

### ðŸ”¹ What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?

A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** is basically a **mini computer built inside a single chip**.  
It has the **processor (CPU)**, **memory**, **peripherals (I/O)**, and **interconnects** all integrated together.  
This makes the chip powerful, compact, and energy efficient â€” thatâ€™s why SoCs are used in mobiles, IoT boards, and smart devices.

**Why itâ€™s useful:**
- Saves a lot of PCB space.  
- Uses very less power.  
- Works faster due to internal connectivity.  
- Reliable and cheaper to produce.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Components of a SoC

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **CPU (Processor)** | The main brain â€” executes instructions, manages everything. |
| **Memory** | RAM for temporary data, ROM for firmware and boot code. |
| **Peripherals / I/O** | Interfaces like UART, SPI, I2C, GPIO, ADC, DAC, etc. |
| **GPU** | Handles all display-related graphics work. |
| **DSP** | Used for signal processing like audio and video. |
| **Power Management Unit** | Distributes power efficiently inside the SoC. |
| **Other Features** | Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and security modules (optional). |

### ðŸ”¹ Types of SoCs

1. **Microcontroller-based SoC** â†’ small and low power (used in IoT, automation).  
2. **Microprocessor-based SoC** â†’ high performance (used in mobiles, SBCs).  
3. **Application-Specific SoC (ASIC)** â†’ made for one fixed purpose (like GPU, AI chip, etc).

### ðŸ”¹ SoC Design Flow

The **SoC Design Flow** starts with an idea and ends with a working chip:
> Specification â†’ RTL Design â†’ Verification â†’ Synthesis â†’ Physical Design â†’ Tapeout

</p>

Each step ensures the chip works correctly before moving to the next stage.

### ðŸ”¹ VSD Baby SoC â€“ Overview

The **VSDBabySoC** is a compact SoC built using the **RISC-V architecture**.  
Itâ€™s made for learning purposes â€” so we can explore how a real SoC works, test RISC-V cores, and understand both **digital and analog integration**.

#### ðŸ§  Main Components

1. **RVMyth SoC** â€“  
   A simple RISC-V processor built for quick understanding.  
   Helps visualize how CPU executes instructions, interacts with memory, and works inside an SoC.

</p>

2. **PLL (Phase-Locked Loop)** â€“  
   Used to generate synchronized clock signals.  
   It ensures that all components of the chip work on stable and matching timing â€” preventing timing mismatches.

</p>
3. **DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter)** â€“  
   Converts digital binary signals into analog voltages.  
   Commonly used in audio output, sensors, or analog interfacing.

   Two types were discussed:
   - **Weighted Resistor DAC**

</p>
   - **R-2R Ladder DAC**

### ðŸ”¹ Summary

So this week I basically learned:
- What a SoC is and how all the blocks connect inside it.  
- Different types of SoCs and their use cases.  
- The flow of SoC design from RTL to final chip.  
- Components of **VSD Baby SoC** like RVMyth, PLL, and DAC.  

This week sets the foundation for **functional modeling and synthesis** in upcoming tasks.
